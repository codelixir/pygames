# pygames 

Trying out making some games with the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) library.\
Also one of my first times at understanding how object oriented programming works.

Navigate to the directory and run
```
python3 game.py
```
make sure you have pygame installed.

## snake

My first go at the pygame library and re-creating the classic snake game. Spacebar to start the game, arrow keys to move.

## naruto

Recreating the river-crossing game, but Naruto themed (everyone goes through a phase in their life that they are not the most proud of). \
Controls are mentioned on the screen. \
